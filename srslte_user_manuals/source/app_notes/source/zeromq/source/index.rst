ZeroMQ Application note
===========================


Introduction
************
srsLTE is a full end-to-end LTE solution comprising a core network, an eNodeB, and a UE implementation. Usually eNodeB and UE
are used with actual RF front-ends for over-the-air transmissions. There are, however, a number
of use-cases for which RF front-ends might not be needed or wanted. Those use-cases include (but are not limited to) the
use of srsLTE for educational or research purposes, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) or development and debugging.

With srsLTE this can be achieved by replacing the radio link between eNodeB and UE with a machanism that allows to
exchange baseband IQ samples over an alternative transport. For this purpose, we've implemented a ZeroMQ-based RF driver that
essentially acts as a transmit and receive pipe for exchanging IQ samples over TCP or IPC.


ZeroMQ Installation
*******************

First thing is to install ZeroMQ and build srsLTE. On Ubuntu, ZeroMQ development libraries can be installed
with:

.. code::

  sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev
  
Alternatively, installing from sources can also be done.

First, one needs to install libzmq:

.. code::

  git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
  cd libzmq
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

Second, install czmq:

.. code::

  git clone https://github.com/zeromq/czmq.git
  cd czmq
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

Finally, you need to compile srsLTE (assuming you have already installed all the required dependencies):

.. code::

  git clone https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE.git
  cd srsLTE
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make

Put extra attention in the cmake console output. Make sure you read the following line:

.. code::

  ...
  -- FINDING ZEROMQ.
  -- Checking for module 'ZeroMQ'
  --   No package 'ZeroMQ' found
  -- Found libZEROMQ: /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib/libzmq.so
  ...

Running a full end-to-end LTE network on a single computer
**********************************************************

Before launching the LTE network components on a single machine we need to make sure
that both UE and EPC are in different network namespaces.
This is because both EPC and UE will be sharing the same network configuration,
i.e. routing tables etc. Because the UE receives an IP address
from the EPC's subnet, the Linux kernel would bypass the TUN interfaces when
routing traffic between both ends. Therefore, we create a separate
network namespace (netns) that the UE uses to create its TUN interface in. 

Note, the examples used here can be found in the following directory: ```./srsLTE/build/lib/```. 
With the UE, eNB and EPC then being called from their associated directory. 

Let's start with creating a new network namespace called "ue1" for the (first) UE:

.. code::

  sudo ip netns add ue1


To verify the new "ue1" netns exists, run:

.. code::
  
  sudo ip netns list


Now let's start the EPC. This will create a TUN device in the default
network namespace and therefore needs root permissions.

.. code::

  sudo ./srsepc/src/srsepc
  
  
Let's now launch the eNodeB. We use the default configuration in this example and pass
all parameters that need to be tweaked for ZMQ through as command line arguments. If you
want to make those persistent just add them to your local enb.conf. The eNB can be
launched without root permissions.

.. code::

  ./srsenb/src/srsenb --rf.device_name=zmq --rf.device_args="fail_on_disconnect=true,tx_port=tcp://*:2000,rx_port=tcp://localhost:2001,id=enb,base_srate=23.04e6"


Lastly we can launch the UE, again with root permissions to create the TUN device.

.. code::

  sudo ./srsue/src/srsue --rf.device_name=zmq --rf.device_args="tx_port=tcp://*:2001,rx_port=tcp://localhost:2000,id=ue,base_srate=23.04e6" --gw.netns=ue1


The last command should start the UE and attach it to the core network.
The UE will be assigned an IP address in the configured range (e.g. 172.16.0.2).

To exchange traffic in the downlink direction, i.e. from the the EPC, just run ping
or iperf as usual on the command line, e.g.:

.. code::
  
  ping 172.16.0.2
  
  
In order to generate traffic in the uplink direction it is important to run the ping command
in the UE's network namespace. 

.. code::

  sudo ip netns exec ue1 ping 172.16.0.1


After finishing, make sure to remove the netns again.

.. code::

  sudo ip netns delete ue1


Known issues
************

* For a clean tear down, the UE needs to be terminated first, then the eNB.
* eNB and UE can only run once, after the UE has been detached, the eNB needs to be restarted.
* We currently only support a single eNB and a single UE.
