Reporting issues
----------------

For contributing code and reporting issues we generally encourage users to directly use the Github's `pull request <https://github.com/srsran/srsran_4g/pulls>`_ or
`issue <https://github.com/srsran/srsran_4g/issues>`_ tracking system. This allows easy tracking and also make enhancements and fixes coming from public users available to everyone immediately.

For issues or fixes that could potentially affect the security of users we also provide a dedicated mail address ``security@srs.io`` that shall be used for
private communication. The srsRAN team will carefully check and analyse each submission and assign a threat category to make sure it is addressed appropriately.
