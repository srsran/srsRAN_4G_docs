Contributions
#############

Contributions to the srsRAN 4G software suite are always welcome. The easiest way to contribute is by issuing a pull request on the `srsRAN 4G repository <https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN_4G>`_. We use clang-format to maintain consistent code style - see our `default format <https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN_4G/blob/master/.clang-format>`_.

We ask srsRAN 4G contributors to agree to a Copyright License Agreement. This provides us with necessary permissions to use contributed code. For more information, see the FAQ below. Viewing and accepting the CLA agreement is integrated into the GitHub pull request workflow using `CLAassistant <https://cla-assistant.io/>`_.

FAQ
*****


1. What is a Copyright License Agreement (CLA) and why do I need one?
=====================================================================

A Copyright License Agreement is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project youâ€™re contributing to and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.

The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.

The agreements used by the srsRAN 4G project are standard documents provided by Project Harmony, a community-centered group focused on contributor agreements for free and open source software (FOSS). For more information, see www.harmonyagreements.org.


2. How do I complete and submit the CLA?
========================================

The srsRAN 4G CLA for Individual contributions can be found :download:`here <SRS-CLA-Individual.pdf>`. The srsRAN 4G CLA for Entity contributions can be found :download:`here <SRS-CLA-Entity.pdf>`. Download the appropriate CLA, then print, sign and scan the document before sending by email to licensing@softwareradiosystems.com.


3. How will my contributions to srsRAN 4G be used?
==================================================

The srsRAN 4G project was created and is maintained by Software Radio Systems (SRS), a private limited company headquartered in Ireland. SRS provides srsRAN 4G under both the open-source AGPLv3 license and commercial licenses. SRS also sells proprietary software products which build upon the srsRAN 4G codebase. In this way, we attempt to ensure the ongoing development, evolution and sustainability of the srsRAN 4G project. 

Through the license agreements, we ask you to grant us permission to use your contributions within srsRAN 4G and to continue to provide srsRAN 4G under open-source and commercial licenses and within proprietary products. As we do not ask for copyright assignment, you retain complete ownership of your contributions and have the same rights to use or license those contributions which you would have had without entering into a license agreement.

If you have any questions about srsRAN 4G licensing and contributions, please contact us at licensing@softwareradiosystems.com
