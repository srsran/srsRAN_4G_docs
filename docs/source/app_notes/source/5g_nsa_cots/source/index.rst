.. _5g_nsa_cots_appnote:

5G NSA COTS UE
##############

.. tip::
    The srsENB supports prototype 5G features for both NSA and SA modes of operation however, these features are no longer under active development. Instead we recommend the `srsRAN Project <https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project>`_, our ORAN-native 5G CU/DU solution.

.. warning::
   Operating a private 5G NSA network on cellular frequency bands may be tightly regulated in your jurisdiction. Seek the approval 
   of your telecommunications regulator before doing so.



Introduction
************

This application note shows how to create your own 5G NSA network using srsENB, srsEPC and a 5G capable COTS UE. There are two options for network setup when connecting a COTS UE: The network can be left as is, and the UE can communicate locally within the network, or the EPC can be connected to the internet through the P-GW, allowing the UE to access the internet for web-browsing, email etc. 

Network & Hardware Overview
***************************

 .. figure:: .imgs/NSA_COTS.png

    Simplified network architecture

Setting up a 5G NSA network and connecting a 5G COTS UE requires the following: 

 - PC with a Linux based OS, with srsRAN 4G installed and built
 - A dual channel RF-frontend with independent RF chains
 - A 5G NSA-capable UE 
 - USIM/ SIM card (This must be a test card or a programmable card, with known keys)

For this implementation the following equipment is used: 
	
	- Desktop computer (minimum 6th Gen i7 or similar) with 10GigE NIC
	- X300 USRP
	- OnePlus Nord 5G with a Sysmocom USIM 

UE Considerations
=================

One of the current limitations of srsRAN 4G is that both LTE and NR carrier have to use the same subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 15 kHz. 
Unfortunately, this limits the band combinations that can be used with COTS phones, as not all combinations
are possible with every baseband chip.

For example, NR band n78 that is used in most European deployments to date (using 30 kHz SCS), in theory, also supports 15 kHz SCS.
However, all phones we've tried with cannot support 15 kHz on this band. Check the supported band combinations for your handset using `this webpage <https://cacombos.com/>`_.

As a consequence, we suggest using FDD bands for both LTE and NR carrier, such as band 20 for LTE and band n3 for NR.
Both bands are supported by the OnePlus 5G Nord used in this appnote.

Besides the restrictions originating from the baseband hardware there are a few other pitfalls that may or may not allow a phone to connect to a 5G network.

- Many 5G handsets may contain a carrier policy file that may limit 5G capabilities of the phone based on the PLMN of the USIM (first 6 digits of IMSI). Carrier policy files typically don't include test network PLMNs, so setting a test PLMN may result in 5G being disabled. If possible, using a shielded box and configuring the network with a commercial carrier PLMN may avoid policy file issues. 
- On some handsets, when using a test USIM, you may need to activate 5G NR using ``*#*#4636#*#*``.
- If your handset supports "Smart 5G", disable this option as it may force the handset to 4G and activate roaming.

Dependencies
************

RF Driver
=========

We've only tested NSA mode with Ettus Research devices using `UHD <https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd>`_. For this appnote we use the USRP X310 with UHD version v3.15.

srsRAN 4G
=========

If you have not already done so, install the latest version of srsRAN 4G and dependencies. This is outlined in the :ref:`installation guide <gen_installation>`. 

.. note::
   If you install or update your driver **after** installing srsRAN 4G, you will have to re-build srsRAN 4G.

Checking Drivers
================

To check that your RF driver has been picked up when running ``cmake ..`` during the build process, you can run: 

``grep <driver> srsRAN_4G/build/CMakeCache.txt``

If you are using UHD as your driver, you should see the following output if srsRAN 4G has successfully detected it when ``cmake ..`` was run:: 

   $ grep UHD -m 4 CMakeCache.txt 

   //Enable UHD
   ENABLE_UHD:BOOL=ON
   UHD_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH=/usr/local/include
   UHD_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/usr/local/lib/libuhd.so

Configuration
**************

The network will have to be configured to support the NSA network and to work with a COTS UE. The following srsRAN 4G configuration files will need to be updated: 

  * :download:`enb.conf<enb.conf>` 
  * :download:`rr.conf <rr.conf>`
  * :download:`epc.conf<epc.conf>`
  * :download:`user_db.csv<user_db.csv>`
 

The enb.conf and epc.conf files will need to be edited such that the MCC & MNC values match those of the USIM. 
The rr.conf needs to be updated to add the NR cell. The user_db.csv file needs to be updated so that it contains the credentials associated with the USIM card being used in the UE.

An APN will also need to be added to the COTS UE to allow it to access the internet. This is reflected in the EPC config file. 

The configuration files used for this example set-up are attached above for reference. Users may need to edit the relevant fields so that their specific COTS UE will be supported by the network. 

Add APN to COTS UE
==================

To add an APN to the UE, navigate to the Network settings for the USIM being used. From here an APN can be added, usually under ``Access point names``. Create a new APN with the name and APN ``test123``, as shown below. 

	.. image:: .imgs/apn_ue.jpg
		:align: center
		:height: 500px

All other settings can be left on the default options. The name of the APN here does not actually matter, as long as the naming is consistent between the UE and the EPC.

srsENB
======

enb.conf
--------

The ``MCC`` & ``MNC`` codes must be updated in the enb.conf to reflect the values used by the sim. These can be edited in the following section of the config file:: 

	#####################################################################
	[enb]
	enb_id = 0x19B
	mcc = 901
	mnc = 70
	mme_addr = 127.0.1.100
	gtp_bind_addr = 127.0.1.1
	s1c_bind_addr = 127.0.1.1
	n_prb = 50
	#tm = 4
	#nof_ports = 2
	
	#####################################################################


For the X310 we've seen acceptable results with the following device arguments::

  [rf]
  device_args=type=x300,clock=external,sampling_rate=11.52e6,lo_freq_offset_hz=11.52e6


The rest of the options can be left at the default values. They may be changed as needed, but further modification 
is not necessary to enable the successful connection of a COTS UE. 

rr.conf 
--------

The main change to the rr.conf file is the addition of the NR cell to the cell list. This is added to the end of the file:: 

	nr_cell_list =
	(
	   {
	    rf_port = 1;
	    cell_id = 0x02;
	    tac = 0x0007;
	    pci = 500;
	    root_seq_idx = 204;

	    // TDD:
	    //dl_arfcn = 634240;
	    //band = 78;

	    // FDD:
	    dl_arfcn = 368500;
	    band = 3;
	  }
	);

Here we have added both the TDD and FDD configs. For this example we will be using the FDD configuration, so the TDD configuration is commented out. Check that the UE model supports the chosen bands.

Core 
====

epc.conf
--------

The EPC config file must be modified to reflect the ``MCC`` & ``MNC``, as well as the ``APN`` being used by the UE:: 
	
	#####################################################################
	[mme]
	mme_code = 0x1a
	mme_group = 0x0001
	tac = 0x0007
	mcc = 901
	mnc = 70
	mme_bind_addr = 127.0.1.100
	apn = test123
	dns_addr = 8.8.8.8
	encryption_algo = EEA0
	integrity_algo = EIA1
	paging_timer = 2
	
	#####################################################################

user_db.csv
-----------

The following list describes the fields contained in the ``user_db.csv`` file. As standard, this file 
will come with two dummy UEs entered into the CSV, these help to provide an example of how the file should be filled in. 

	- Name: Any human readable value
	- Auth: Authentication algorithm (xor/ mil)
	- IMSI: UE's IMSI value
	- Key: UE's key, hex value
	- OP Type: Operator's code type (OP/ OPc)
	- OP: OP/ OPc code, hex value
	- AMF: Authentication management field, hex value must be above 8000
	- SQN: UE's Sequence number for freshness of the authentication
	- QCI: QoS Class Identifier for the UE's default bearer
	- IP Alloc: IP allocation strategy for the SPGW

The AMF, SQN, QCI and IP Alloc fields can be populated with the following values for the COTS UE: 
	
	- 9000, 000000000000, 9, dynamic

This will result in a user_db.csv file that should look something like the following:: 

	#                                                                                           
	# .csv to store UE's information in HSS                                                     
	# Kept in the following format: "Name,Auth,IMSI,Key,OP_Type,OP,AMF,SQN,QCI,IP_alloc"      
	#                                                                                           
	# Name:     Human readable name to help distinguish UE's. Ignored by the HSS                
	# IMSI:     UE's IMSI value                                                                 
	# Auth:     Authentication algorithm used by the UE. Valid algorithms are XOR               
	#           (xor) and MILENAGE (mil)                                                        
	# Key:      UE's key, where other keys are derived from. Stored in hexadecimal              
	# OP_Type:  Operator's code type, either OP or OPc                                          
	# OP/OPc:   Operator Code/Cyphered Operator Code, stored in hexadecimal                     
	# AMF:      Authentication management field, stored in hexadecimal                          
	# SQN:      UE's Sequence number for freshness of the authentication                        
	# QCI:      QoS Class Identifier for the UE's default bearer.                               
	# IP_alloc: IP allocation stratagy for the SPGW.                                            
	#           With 'dynamic' the SPGW will automatically allocate IPs                         
	#           With a valid IPv4 (e.g. '172.16.0.2') the UE will have a statically assigned IP.
	#                                                                                           
	# Note: Lines starting by '#' are ignored and will be overwritten                           
	COTS_UE,mil,901700000020936,4933f9c5a83e5718c52e54066dc78dcf,opc,fc632f97bd249ce0d16ba79e6505d300,9000,0000000060f8,9,dynamic

The auth, IMSI, key, OP Type and OP are values associated with the USIM being used. The values assigned to the AMF, SQN, QCI & IP Alloc are the default values above, which is explained further :ref:`here <config_csv>` in the EPC documentation. Ensure there is no white space between the values in each entry, as this will cause the file to be read incorrectly. 

Masquerading Script
===================

To allow UE to connect to the internet via the EPC, the pre-configured masquerading script must be run. This can be found in ``srsRAN_4G/srsepc``. 

The masquerading script enables IP forwarding and sets up Network Address Translation to pass traffic between the srsRAN 4G network and the external network. The script must be run each time the machine is re-booted, and can be done before or while the srsRAN 4G is running. The UE will not be able to communicate with the wider internet until this script has been run. 

Before running the script it is important to identify the interface being used to connect your PC to the internet. The script requires this as an argument as shown below:: 

   route

You will see an output similar to the following:: 

   Kernel IP routing table
   Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
   default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 enxc03ebab05013
   10.12.1.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 enxc03ebab05013


The interface (Iface) associated with the *default* destination is one which must be passed into the masq. script. In the above output that is the ``enxc03ebab05013`` interface. 

The masq. script can now be run from the follow folder: ``srsRAN_4G/srsEPC`` :: 

	sudo ./srsepc_if_masq.sh <interface>

If it has executed successfully you will see the following message::

	Masquerading Interface <interface>
	
The configuration files, user DB and UE are now set up appropriately to allow the COTS UE to connect to the eNB and Core. 


Connecting to the Network
*************************

The final step in connecting a COTS UE to srsRAN 4G is to first run the EPC and eNB, and then connect to that network from the UE. 
The following sections will outline how this is achieved.

Core
==== 
First run srsEPC:: 
	
	sudo srsepc
	
The following output should be displayed on the console:: 

	Built in Release mode using commit c892ae56b on branch master.
	
	---  Software Radio Systems EPC  ---

	MME Initialized. MCC: 0xf901, MNC: 0xff70
	SPGW GTP-U Initialized.
	SPGW S11 Initialized.
	SP-GW Initialized.

srsENB
======

Now start srsENB:: 

	sudo srsenb 
	
The console should display the following or similar:: 

	---  Software Radio Systems LTE eNodeB  ---

	Setting frequency: DL=1842.5 Mhz, UL=1747.5 MHz for cc_idx=1 nof_prb=52

The EPC console should now print an update if the eNB has successfully connected to the core:: 
		
	Received S1 Setup Request.
	S1 Setup Request - eNB Name: srsenb01, eNB id: 0x19b

	Sending S1 Setup Response
		
The network is now ready for the COTS UE to connect.

UE
===

You can now connect the UE to the network by taking the following steps: 

Open the Settings menu and navigate to the Sim & Network options

.. image:: .imgs/ue_settings.jpg
	:align: center
	:height: 500px

Open this menu and proceed to the sub-menu associated with the USIM being used. It should look something like the following: 

.. image:: .imgs/sim_settings.jpg
	:align: center
	:height: 500px

Under the Network Operators find the network which you have just instantiated using srsRAN 4G.

Select the network that is a combination of your MMC & MNC values. The UE should then automatically connect to the network. 

Confirming connection
*********************

Once the UE has connected to the network, the console outputs of the srsENB and srsEPC can be used to confirm a successful connection. 

srsENB
======
If a successful connection is made, a ``RACH`` message should be seen followed by a ``USER <ID> connected`` message where "<ID>" is the RNTI assigned to the UE::

	==== eNodeB started ===
	Type <t> to view trace

The UE is now connected to the network and should now automatically connect to this network each time it is powered on. The UE should now also have access to the internet - as if connected to a commercial 5G network.

Troubleshooting
***************

UE not attaching to network
===========================

- Some UEs have issues detecting networks operating on a test PLMN such as 00101. Using the MCC of your local country can increase the chance to find the network. When using a shielded environment, better results may be seen when using the PLMN of a local commercial network. 

.. warning::
   To avoid causing interference to local commercial networks, carry out tests using a shielded environment. 


NR carrier has high error rate
==============================

One of the current limitation of the NR scheduler is missing dynamic MCS adaptation. Therefore, a fixed MCS is used for both downlink (PDSCH) and uplink (PUSCH) transmissions.
By default we use the maximum value of MCS 28 for maximum rate. Depending on the RF condiditions this, however, may be too high. In this case, try to use a lower MCS, e.g.::


	[scheduler]
	nr_pdsch_mcs = 10
	nr_pusch_mcs = 10


Ettus Research USRP N310
========================

The N310 is another device that can be used for NSA. However, a few changes need to be made to the configuration files.

In the enb.conf we need to change the device arguments to pick the right RF subdevice (band 20 for LTE and band n3 for NR are too far apart to use the default) and also use sample rates supported by the N310::

	[rf]
	device_args = type=n3xx,tx_subdev_spec=A:0 B:0,rx_subdev_spec=A:0 B:0

	[expert]
	lte_sample_rates = true


The tests have been made with the N310 using UHD 4.1.
