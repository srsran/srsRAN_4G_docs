5G NSA End-to-End
#################

.. tip::
    The srsENB supports prototype 5G features for both NSA and SA modes of operation however, these features are no longer under active development. Instead we recommend the `srsRAN Project <https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project>`_, our ORAN-native 5G CU/DU solution.

The 21.10 release of srsRAN brings 5G NSA support to the SRS eNodeB application (srsENB). 
5G NSA features can be enabled via the srsENB configuration files.
This application note shows how to create an end-to-end 5G NSA Network using srsUE, srsENB and srsEPC.
The ZMQ virtual radio is used in place of physical RF hardware.

5G NSA Overview

	5G NSA Mode 3

5G Non-Standalone mode provides 5G support by building upon and using pre-existing 4G infrastructure.
A secondary 5G carrier is provided in addition to the primary 4G carrier. A 5G NSA UE connects first 
to the 4G carrier before connecting to the secondary 5G carrier. The 4G anchor is used
for control plane signaling while the 5G carrier is used for high-speed data plane traffic.

This approach has been used for the majority of commercial 5G network deployments to date. It provides
improved data rates while leveraging existing 4G infrastructure. UEs must support 5G NSA to take advantage
of 5G NSA services, but existing 4G devices are not disrupted.

Network & Hardware Overview
***************************

For this application note we will be using `ZeroMQ <https://zeromq.org/>`_ in place of physical RF hardware. A detailed outline of how to 
install and use ZMQ with srsRAN can be found :ref:`here <zeromq_appnote>`. This app note will assume prior knowledge of use of ZMQ with srsRAN.

	Simplified overview of the network architecture

This set up requires the following: 

	* srsUE running in a seperate network namespace 
	* srsENB configured so that both an LTE eNB, and an NSA gNB cell are created at run time 
	* srsEPC with the UE included in the list of subscribers 

Using RF-Hardware
=================

To create a physical end-to-end network using RF-hardware, the following is required:

.. list-table:: NSA Network Hardware Requirements
   :widths: 25 20 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Network Element
     - RF-Frontend
     - Linux based PC 
   * - srsUE
     - X3xx USRP
     - X
   * - srsENB & srsGNB 
     - X3xx USRP
     - X
   * - srsEPC
     - 
     - X
	
Such a set-up requires two X3xx series USRPs and 2 Linux PCS.

It is recommended to use an `X3xx series USRP <https://www.ettus.com/product-categories/usrp-x-series/>`_ with a `UBX Daughterboard <https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ubx40/>`_. Other RF hardware featuring dual channel Tx and Rx with independent RF chains may also be supported.

Network Configuration
*********************

Changes need to be made to the configuration files of srsUE and srsENB. These changes enable the use of ZMQ and also enable the 5G NSA carrier in srsENB. No srsEPC configuration changes are required. 

Example config files used in this note are available for download. Only modified configs are included here, default configs can be used elsewhere. All changes are outlined in the following sections. 

	* :download:`ue.conf<.configs/ue_example.conf>` 
	* :download:`enb.conf<.configs/enb_example.conf>` 
	* :download:`rr.conf<.configs/rr_example.conf>` 

srsUE
=====
For srsUE the relevant changes need to be made to ``ue.conf`` to enable ZMQ and 5G NR capabilities.

ZMQ 
---

As per the description in the :ref:`ZMQ app-note <zeromq_appnote>`, to enable ZMQ the **device_name** and **device_args** must be changed in the **[rf]** section:: 

	device_name = zmq
	device_args = tx_port0=tcp://*:2001,rx_port0=tcp://localhost:2000,tx_port1=tcp://*:2101,rx_port1=tcp://localhost:2100,id=ue,base_srate=23.04e6

Here we add two TX and two RX channels to support both the 4G primary and 5G secondary carriers, as outlined in the network diagram.

To complete the ZMQ set-up, the network namespace **netns** must be set under the **[gw]** settings:: 

	[gw]
	netns = ue1

NR RAT
------

The 5G NR capabilities of the UE must also be enabled in the config under the **[rat.nr]** section:: 


  [rat.nr]
  bands = 3,78
  nof_carriers = 1 

Here we enable bands 3 and 78, which are FDD and TDD frequency bands respectively. By including both in the UE config, we can test each duplex mode simply by configuring the network.

The number of NR carriers needs to be set to 1, or else the UE will not be able to connect to the gNB. If this was not set, it would result in the UE only having an LTE connection. 

Release
-------

As NSA Mode is part of 3GPP **release 15**, this must be reflected in the config. The default release used is 8. Add the following entry under the **[rrc]** field:: 


  [rrc]
  release = 15 

srsENB
======

Changes need to be made to both ``enb.conf`` and ``rr.conf`` to enable 5G NSA. 

eNB Config
----------

First the the changes required to enable ZMQ should be made. This involves changing the **device_name** and **device_args** in the **[rf]** section:: 

	device_name = zmq
	device_args = fail_on_disconnect=true,tx_port0=tcp://*:2000,rx_port0=tcp://localhost:2001,tx_port1=tcp://*:2100,rx_port1=tcp://localhost:2101,id=enb,base_srate=23.04e6	

Similarly to the UE there are two TX and two RX channels. These channels are mapped to the relevent ports configured on the UE. 

No other changes are needed in the enb.conf. 

RRC Config
----------

The main change to the rr.conf file is the addition of the NR cell to the cell list. This is added to the end of the file:: 

	nr_cell_list =
	(
	   {
	    rf_port = 1;
	    cell_id = 0x02;
	    tac = 0x0007;
	    pci = 500;
	    root_seq_idx = 204;

	    // TDD:
	    //dl_arfcn = 634240;
	    //band = 78;

	    // FDD:
	    dl_arfcn = 368500;
	    band = 3;
	  }
	);

Here we have added both the TDD and FDD configs. For this example we will be using the FDD configuration, so the TDD configuration is commented out. The TDD and FDD configs can be swapped 
by stopping srsENB, making the necessary changes to this file, and restarting srsENB. 

Network Set-up
**************

With the above configurations, the network can now be started. Run the EPC first, followed by the eNodeB and the UE.

EPC
===

First run the EPC:: 

	sudo srsepc 

You should then see a similar output to the following:: 

	HSS Initialized.
	MME S11 Initialized
	MME GTP-C Initialized
	MME Initialized. MCC: 0xf001, MNC: 0xff01
	SPGW GTP-U Initialized.
	SPGW S11 Initialized.
	SP-GW Initialized.


eNB
===

Next run the eNB/ gNB:: 

	sudo srsenb 

The following output, or similar, will be seen if srsENB as started correctly:: 

	Opening 2 channels in RF device=zmq with args=fail_on_disconnect=true,tx_port0=tcp://*:2000,rx_port0=tcp://localhost:2001,tx_port1=tcp://*:2100,rx_port1=tcp://localhost:2101,id=enb,base_srate=23.04e6
	CHx base_srate=23.04e6
	CHx id=enb
	Current sample rate is 1.92 MHz with a base rate of 23.04 MHz (x12 decimation)
	CH0 rx_port=tcp://localhost:2001
	CH0 tx_port=tcp://*:2000
	CH0 fail_on_disconnect=true
	CH1 rx_port=tcp://localhost:2101
	CH1 tx_port=tcp://*:2100

	==== eNodeB started ===
	Type <t> to view trace
	Current sample rate is 11.52 MHz with a base rate of 23.04 MHz (x2 decimation)
	Current sample rate is 11.52 MHz with a base rate of 23.04 MHz (x2 decimation)
	Setting frequency: DL=2680.0 Mhz, UL=2560.0 MHz for cc_idx=0 nof_prb=50
	Setting frequency: DL=1842.5 Mhz, UL=1747.5 MHz for cc_idx=1 nof_prb=52

Note how two cells have been created, with IDs 0 and 1. 0 is the LTE cell, and 1 is the NR cell. 

If the eNB successfully attaches to the core, the console trace for the EPC should update. 

UE
==

The UE should now be run using:: 

	sudo srsue

If it runs and connects to the eNB/ gNB successfully, you should see something like the following:: 

	Opening 2 channels in RF device=zmq with args=tx_port0=tcp://*:2001,rx_port0=tcp://localhost:2000,tx_port1=tcp://*:2101,rx_port1=tcp://localhost:2100,id=ue,base_srate=23.04e6

The following message ``RRC NR reconfiguration successful`` confirms that the UE has connected to the NR cell. This will be used for the data link, while the LTE cell will 
be used for control messaging. 

Updates will also be seen in the eNB and EPC consoles. 

Testing the Network
===================

Traffic can be sent through the network to test the connection. Using either ``ping`` or ``iperf3`` allows traffic to be sent from the UE to the gNB. An example of using ``ping`` can 
be found in the :ref:`ZMQ app-note <zeromq_appnote>`, so for this example ``iperf3`` will be used. 

iPerf 
-----

In this setup the client will run on the UE side with the server on the network side. UDP traffic will be generated at 10Mbps for 60 seconds. When running the iperf client, we use the UE network namespace and specify the network-side IP address. It is important to start the server first, and then the client.

Network-side 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start the iPerf server:: 

	iperf3 -s -i 1 

This will then listen for traffic coming from the UE. 

UE-side
^^^^^^^

With the network and the iPerf server up and running, the client can be run from the UE's network namespace with following command:: 

	sudo ip netns exec ue1 iperf3 -c 172.16.0.1 -b 10M -i 1 -t 60 

Traffic will now be sent from the UE to the eNB. This will be shown in both the server and client consoles, and also in the trace for both the UE and the eNB. Example **client** iPerf output::

UE Trace 
---------

The UE console trace can be enabled by entering ``t`` on the UE console. The trace is updated every second. 

.. note::
   The time interval between metrics reports can be changed in the UE config file under the ``[general]`` field, by changing the value of ``metrics_period_secs``. 

If traffic is being successfully sent across the network, then the UE console trace should like something like this:: 

	---------Signal-----------|-----------------DL-----------------|-----------UL-----------

The ``rat`` field reports if a metric is associated with the NSA 5G link (nr), or with the LTE link (lte). 

eNB/ gNB Trace
--------------

The eNB/ gNB trace can also be enabled by entering ``t`` on the console. The metrics are reported every second. 

.. note::
	This can also be changed in the eNB config file, under the ``[expert]`` heading, by changing the value of ``metrics_period_secs``.
   
The console trace should look like the following if traffic is being transmitted successfully::

Similarly to the UE console trace, the ``rat`` field denotes which link the metrics reported are associated with. 

GUI 
***

.. image:: .imgs/gui.png
		:align: center
		
srsGUI is also supported for use with the UE in NSA mode. An example of the plots produced can be seen above. 

To enable srsGUI, see `here <https://github.com/srslte/srsgui>`_. 

.. Note:: 

	If you have already built srsRAN without srsGUI support, you must re-do so after srsGUI has been built.
