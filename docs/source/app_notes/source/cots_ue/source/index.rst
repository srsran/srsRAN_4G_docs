.. srsRAN 4G COTS UE Application Note

.. _cots_ue_appnote:

COTS UE
=======

.. warning::
	 Please note, operating a private LTE network on cellular frequency bands may be tightly regulated in your jurisdiction. Seek the approval of your telecommunications regulator before doing so.

Introduction
************
This application note aims to demonstrate how to set up your own LTE network using srsENB, srsEPC and a COTS UE. There are two options for network set-up when connecting a COTS UE: The network can be left as is, 
and the UE can communicate locally within the network, or the EPC can be connected to the internet through the P-GW, allowing the UE to access the internet for 
web-browsing, email etc. 

Hardware Required
----------------------------
Creating a network and connecting a COTS UE requires the following: 

 - PC with a Linux based OS, with srsRAN 4G installed and built
 - An RF-frontend capable of both Tx & Rx
 - A COTS UE 
 - USIM/ SIM card (This must be a test card or a programmable card, with known keys)
 
The following diagram outlines the set-up: 
 
 .. image:: .imgs/cots_ue.png
 
For this implementation the following equipment was used: 
	
	- Razer Blade Stealth running Ubuntu 18.04
	- B200 mini USRP
	- Sony Xperia XA with a Sysmocom USIM 
	
The following photo shows the real world implementation of the equipment for this use case:

Note, this is for illustrative purposes, this orientation of USRP and UE may not give the best stability & throughput.

Driver & Conf. File Set-Up
******************************
Before instantiating the network and connecting the UE you need to first ensure you have the correct drivers installed and that the configuration files are edited appropriately. 

Drivers
----------
Firstly, check that you have the appropriate drivers for your SDR installed. If not they must be downloaded from the relevant source. If the drivers are already installed ensure 
they are up to date and are from a stable release. This step can be skipped if you have the correct drivers and know them to be working. 

* RF front-end drivers:

  * UHD:                 https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd
  * SoapySDR:            https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR
  * BladeRF:             https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF

.. note::
  This app note was tested using a b200-mini and UHD v4.0, but we recommend using UHD v3.15 where possible.  

When the drivers have been installed/ updated you should connect your hardware and check that everything is working correctly. To do this for a USRP using the UHD drivers run the following command:: 

	uhd_usrp_probe

This should be done anytime you are using a USRP before carrying out any testing or implementation to check a stable connection to the radio. Note, you should be using a USB 3.0 interface
when using an SDR for this use case.  

If you have had to install or update your drivers and everything is working as intended, then you will need to rebuild srsRAN 4G to ensure it picks up on the new/ updated drivers. 

To make a clean build execute the following commands in your terminal:: 
	
		cd ./srsRAN_4G/build
		rm CMakeCache.txt
		make clean
		cmake ..
		make
		
Your hardware and drivers should now be working correctly and be ready to use for connecting a COTS UE to srsRAN 4G. 

Conf. Files
----------------
The base configuration files for srsRAN 4G can be installed by running the following command in the build folder:: 

	sudo srsran_4g_install_configs.sh <user/service>
	
You have the option to install the configurations files to the user directory or for all users. For this example the configuration files have been installed for all users by
running the following command ``sudo srsran_4g_install_configs.sh service``. The config files can then be found in the following folder: ``~./etc/srsran_4g``

You will need to edit the following files before you can run a COTS UE over the network: 

 - epc.conf
 - enb.conf
 - user_db.csv 
 
The eNB & EPC config files will need to be edited such that the MCC & MNC values are the same across both files. The user DB file needs to be updated so that 
it contains the credentials associated with the USIM card being used in the UE. 
 
**EPC:**

The following snippet shows where to change the MCC & MNC values in the EPC config file:: 
	
	22 | #####################################################################
	23 | [mme]
	24 | mme_code = 0x1a
	25 | mme_group = 0x0001
	26 | tac = 0x0007
	27 | mcc = 901
	28 | mnc = 70
	29 | mme_bind_addr = 127.0.1.100
	30 | apn = srsapn
	31 | dns_addr = 8.8.8.8
	32 | encryption_algo = EEA0
	33 | integrity_algo = EIA1
	34 | paging_timer = 2
	35 | 
	36 | #####################################################################
	
Line 27 and 28 must be changed, for Sysmocom USIMS these values are 901 & 70. These values will be dependent on the USIM being used. 
	
**eNB:**

The above changes must be mirrored in the eNB config. file. The following snippet shows this:: 

	18 | #####################################################################
	19 | [enb]
	20 | enb_id = 0x19B
	21 | mcc = 901
	22 | mnc = 70
	23 | mme_addr = 127.0.1.100
	24 | gtp_bind_addr = 127.0.1.1
	25 | s1c_bind_addr = 127.0.1.1
	26 | n_prb = 50
	27 | #tm = 4
	28 | #nof_ports = 2
	29 | 
	30 | #####################################################################

Here, the MCC and MNC values at lines 21 & 22 are changed to the values used in the EPC. 

For both of the config files the rest of the values can be left at the default values. They may be changed as needed, but further customization 
is not necessary to enable the successful connection of a COTS UE. 

**User DB:**

The following list describes the fields contained in the ``user_db.csv`` file, found in the same folder as the .conf files. As standard, this file 
will come with two dummy UEs entered into the CSV, these help to provide an example of how the file should be filled in. 

	- Name: Any human readable value
	- Auth: Authentication algorithm (xor/ mil)
	- IMSI: UE's IMSI value
	- Key: UE's key, hex value
	- OP Type: Operator's code type (OP/ OPc)
	- OP: OP/ OPc code, hex value
	- AMF: Authentication management field, hex value must be above 8000
	- SQN: UE's Sequence number for freshness of the authentication
	- QCI: QoS Class Identifier for the UE's default bearer
	- IP Alloc: IP allocation strategy for the SPGW

The AMF, SQN, QCI and IP Alloc fields can be populated with the following values: 
	
	- 9000, 000000000000, 9, dynamic

This will result in a user_db.csv file that should look something like the following:: 

	1 | #                                                                                           
	2 | # .csv to store UE's information in HSS                                                     
	3 | # Kept in the following format: "Name,Auth,IMSI,Key,OP_Type,OP,AMF,SQN,QCI,IP_alloc"      
	4 | #                                                                                           
	5 | # Name:     Human readable name to help distinguish UE's. Ignored by the HSS                
	6 | # IMSI:     UE's IMSI value                                                                 
	7 | # Auth:     Authentication algorithm used by the UE. Valid algorithms are XOR               
	8 | #           (xor) and MILENAGE (mil)                                                        
	9 | # Key:      UE's key, where other keys are derived from. Stored in hexadecimal              
	10| # OP_Type:  Operator's code type, either OP or OPc                                          
	11| # OP/OPc:   Operator Code/Cyphered Operator Code, stored in hexadecimal                     
	12| # AMF:      Authentication management field, stored in hexadecimal                          
	13| # SQN:      UE's Sequence number for freshness of the authentication                        
	14| # QCI:      QoS Class Identifier for the UE's default bearer.                               
	15| # IP_alloc: IP allocation stratagy for the SPGW.                                            
	16| #           With 'dynamic' the SPGW will automatically allocate IPs                         
	17| #           With a valid IPv4 (e.g. '172.16.0.2') the UE will have a statically assigned IP.
	18| #                                                                                           
	19| # Note: Lines starting by '#' are ignored and will be overwritten                           
	20| ue3,mil,901700000020936,4933f9c5a83e5718c52e54066dc78dcf,opc,fc632f97bd249ce0d16ba79e6505d300,9000,0000000060f8,9,dynamic

Line 20 shows the entry for the USIM being used in the COTS UE. The values assigned to the AMF, SQN, QCI & IP Alloc are default values above, 
as outlined :ref:`here <config_csv>` in the EPC documentation. Ensure there is no white space between the values in each entry, as this will cause 
the file to be read incorrectly. 

Adding an APN
----------------------

An APN is needed to allow the UE to access the internet. This is created from the UE and then a change is made to the EPC config file to reflect this. 

From the UE navigate to the Network settings for the SIM being used. From here an APN can be added, usually under *"Access point names"*. Create a new APN with the name and APN "test123", as shown in the following figure. 

	.. image:: .imgs/apn_ue.jpg
		:align: center
		:height: 360px

The addition of this APN must be reflected in the EPC config file, to do this add the APN to the config. This is shown in the following snippet:: 

	22 | #####################################################################
	23 | [mme]
	24 | mme_code = 0x1a
	25 | mme_group = 0x0001
	26 | tac = 0x0007
	27 | mcc = 901
	28 | mnc = 70
	29 | mme_bind_addr = 127.0.1.100
	30 | apn = test123
	31 | dns_addr = 8.8.8.8
	32 | encryption_algo = EEA0
	33 | integrity_algo = EIA1
	34 | paging_timer = 2
	35 | 
	36 | #####################################################################
		
The APN has been added at line 30 above. This must match the APN on the UE to enable a successful connection. 

Run Masquerading Script
------------------------------------
To allow UE to connect to the internet via the EPC, the pre-configured masquerading script must be run. This can be found in ``srsRAN_4G//srsepc``. The 
masquerading script enables IP forwarding and sets up Network Address Translation to pass traffic between the srsRAN 4G network and the external network. 
The script must be run each time the machine is re-booted, and can be done before or while the network is running. The UE will not be able to communicate 
with the interet until this script has been run. 

Before running the script it is important to identify the interface being used to connect your PC to the internet. As the script requires this to be passed 
in as an argument. This can be done by running the following command::

	route

You will see an output similar to the following:: 

	Kernel IP routing table
	Destination    	Gateway       Genmask        Flags 	Metric 	Ref    Use   	Iface
	default         192.168.1.1   0.0.0.0        UG    	600    	0        0 	wlp2s0
	link-local      0.0.0.0       255.255.0.0    U     	1000   	0        0	wlp2s0
	192.168.1.0  	0.0.0.0       255.255.255.0  U     	600    	0        0 	wlp2s0

The interface (Iface) associated with the *default* destination is one which must be passed into the masq. script. In the above output that is the wlp2s0 interface. 

The masq. script can now be run from the follow folder: ``srsRAN_4G/srsEPC``::

	sudo ./srsepc_if_masq.sh <interface>

If it has executed successfully you will see the following message:: 

	Masquerading Interface <interface>
	
The configuration files, user DB and UE should now be set up appropriately to allow the COTS UE to connect to the eNB and Core. 

Connecting a COTS UE to srsRAN 4G
****************************************

The final step in connecting a COTS UE to srsRAN 4G is to first spin up the network and then connect to that network from the UE. The following sections 
will outline how this is achieved. 

Running srsEPC & srsENB
---------------------------------------

First navigate to the srsRAN 4G folder. Then initialise the EPC by running:: 
	
	sudo srsepc
	
The following output should be displayed on the console:: 

	Built in Release mode using commit c892ae56b on branch master.
	
	---  Software Radio Systems EPC  ---
	
	Reading configuration file /etc/srsran_4g/epc.conf...

	MME GTP-C Initialized
	MME Initialized. MCC: 0xf901, MNC: 0xff70
	SPGW GTP-U Initialized.
	SPGW S11 Initialized.
	SP-GW Initialized.


The eNB can then be brought online in a separate console by running::

	sudo srsenb 
	
The console should display the following::

	---  Software Radio Systems LTE eNodeB  ---

	Reading configuration file /etc/srsran_4g/enb.conf...
	
	Built in Release mode using commit c892ae56b on branch master.

	Setting frequency: DL=2685.0 Mhz, UL=2565.0 MHz for cc_idx=0
	
	==== eNodeB started ===
	Type <t> to view trace

	
The EPC console should now print an update if the eNB has successfully connected to the core:: 
		
	Received S1 Setup Request.
	S1 Setup Request - eNB Name: srsenb01, eNB id: 0x19b
	S1 Setup Request - MCC:901, MNC:70, PLMN: 651527
	S1 Setup Request - TAC 0, B-PLMN 0
	S1 Setup Request - Paging DRX v128
	Sending S1 Setup Response
		
The network is now ready for the COTS UE to connect. 
		
Connecting the UE
---------------------------

Connecting the UE to the network is a quick and easy process if the above steps have been completed successfully.

You can now connect the UE to the network by taking the following steps: 

	- Open the Settings menu and navigate to the Sim & Network options

	.. image:: .imgs/ue_settings.jpg
		:align: center
		:height: 360px

	- Open this menu and proceed to the sub-menu associated with the USIM being used. It should look something like the following: 

	.. image:: .imgs/sim_settings.jpg
		:align: center
		:height: 360px

	- Under the Network Operators find the network which you have just instantiated using srsRAN 4G

	.. image:: .imgs/networks.jpg
		:align: center
		:height: 360px

	- Select the network that is a combination of your MMC & MNC values. For this example it is the network labelled 90170 4G. The UE should then automatically connect to the network. 
	
The UE should now be connected to the network. To check for a successful connection use the logs output to the console. 

Confirming Connection
----------------------

Once the UE has connected to the network, the console outputs of the srsENB and srsEPC can be used to confirm a successful connection. 

**EPC Console:**

The following output is shown for the EPC after a successful attach. First a confirmation message in the form of *UL NAS: Received Attach Complete* will be displayed, secondly
the EPS bearers will be given out and the ID confirmed on the output, and lastly the *Sending EMM Information Message* output will be shown. If all of these are displayed in the 
logs, then an attach is successful. These messages are seen in the last five lines of the console output in the following console output:: 

	Built in Release mode using commit c892ae56b on branch master.

**eNB Console:**

The eNB console also display messages to confirm an attach. A *RACH* message should be seen followed by a *USER 0xX connected* message. Where "*0xX*" is a hex ID representing the UE. 

NOTE, you may see some other RACHs and *Disconnecting rtni=0xX* messages. This may be from other devices trying to connect to the network, if you have seen a clear connection between the UE and network 
these can be ignored. 

The following shows an output from the eNB that indicates a successful attach::

The UE is now connected to the network. and should now automatically connect to this network each time it is powered on. You should keep the UE in airplane mode until you want to connect it to the network. The UE should now also have access to the internet - as if connected to a commercial 4G network.


Troubleshooting
****************
- If the phone has troubles finding the network or can't stay connected it might be due to frequency shifts and drifting of the eNB signal, caused by inaccurate clocks.
  We therefore always recommend to use an external 10 MHz reference clock or a GPSDO-disciplined clock for the eNB.

- Some users may experience trouble connecting to the internet, even after running the masquerading script. Ensure that IP forwarding is enabled, and check your network configuration as this may be stopping the UE from connecting successfully. 

- Users may also have trouble connecting to the network. Firstly check all information in the configuration and user DB files are correct. You may also need to adjust the gain parameters in the eNB config. file - without high enough power (pmax threshold), the UE won't PRACH. 

- Note that some USIM cards may not be compatible in UEs that are "locked" to certain network operators.
